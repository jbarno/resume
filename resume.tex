  {\em Software Engineer in Test Genomic Data Commons} \hfill {\bf  June 17 - Present}\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Making the auto\_qa repository into a functional service. We can now deploy auto\_qa as a service within
a cluster to validate that particular cluster. We are able to now run chrome headlessly both locally and on
an auto\_qa service. Additionally, these tests are able to be scheduled at regular intervals. Before this was
a manual process to run auto\_qa locally while connected to a VPN to validate that given environment. We
now have the ability to conditionally execute tests which require authorization tokens. Finally, auto\_qa had
26 runnable tests when I started, it is now 239. At least 150 of those were written by me.
  \item Working within the gdcapi for both “unit” and end to end tests. Refactored the gdcapi unit tests to to
maintain consistent code coverage with reduced execution time (on TravisCI from ~30 min to ~8 min).
This allows developers to move faster with the confidence that their changes did not break anything (that
we’re testing). Automated 60\\% (12/20) of the API regression tests by translating curl calls to simple
python tests utilizing the requests library. These tests run daily, and will free up one manual tester for
about half a day per release cycle. Identified pain points within the gdcapi around BAM slicing requests
producing unnecessary crosstalk through consul to other gdcapi machines.
