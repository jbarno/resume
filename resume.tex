\section{\sc Employment}

\begin{list1}

\item [] {\bf DocuSign}, Chicago, IL\\
\item [] {\em Linux DevOps Engineer} \hfill {\bf April 19 - Oct 20}

\begin{list2}
\item  Automated patching, and rebooting, of Linux systems across multiple data centers.
\item  Augmented existing tools for the benefit of operators and developers.
\item  Uncovered and rectified numerous logic, configuration, and data flaws.
\item  Handled patching both physical and virtual infrastructure, mostly containing data systems.
\item  Participated in FedRAMP audit interviews for renewal of SpringCM’s status.
\item  Tools utilized: SaltStack, Gitlab, VMWare, Hashicorp’s Consul and Vault.\\
\end{list2}

\item [] {\bf University of Chicago, Center for Data Intensive Science}, Chicago, IL\\
\item [] {\em Lead QA Engineer Genomic Data Commons} \hfill {\bf June 18 - March 19}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Led operational readiness review meetings (a Go, No-Go, decision meeting) with multiple stake-
holders per release. The most common stakeholders were the Ontario Institue of Cancer Research
(OICR) and National Institue of Health (NIH). Found and presented existing system and data
defects to advise the room on a course of action.
\item Led a team of two FTE SDETs and four student interns validating and automating validation of
new features and regressions. Took on mentor status with a few students, advising them on how
to best acheive their goals. Interviewed numerous devops and SDET candidates. Reviewed tens of
thousands lines of code.
\item Assisted with design and architecture development. Including versioning of files at the Petabyte
scale, segmenting data between users, and a quarterly meeting at NIH headquarters to discuss
future infastructure improvements and workflow designs.
\item Utilized the python library PyPOM (Page Object Model) to greatly reduce copy and pasted test
code, and increase the maintainablity of our testing infastructure. This library is instrumental in
giving all testers a consistent way to solve timing problems in test code.
\end{enumerate}
\item [] {\em Software Engineer in Test Genomic Data Commons} \hfill {\bf June 17 - June 18}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Making the auto\_qa repository into a functional service. We can now deploy auto\_qa as a service within
a cluster to validate that particular cluster. We are able to now run chrome headlessly both locally and on
an auto\_qa service. Additionally, these tests are able to be scheduled at regular intervals. Before this was
a manual process to run auto\_qa locally while connected to a VPN to validate that given environment. We
now have the ability to conditionally execute tests which require authorization tokens. Finally, auto\_qa had
26 runnable tests when I started, it is now 239. At least 150 of those were written by me.
\item Working within the gdcapi for both “unit” and end to end tests. Refactored the gdcapi unit tests to to
maintain consistent code coverage with reduced execution time (on TravisCI from ~30 min to ~8 min).
This allows developers to move faster with the confidence that their changes did not break anything.
Automated (12/20) of the API regression tests by translating curl calls to simple
python tests utilizing the requests library. These tests run daily, and will free up one manual tester for
about half a day per release cycle. Identified pain points within the gdcapi around BAM slicing requests
producing unnecessary crosstalk through consul to other gdcapi machines.\\
\end{enumerate}
